## Songs select in React-Redux
Created this playground just to find way to put together and use React with Redux.
There are two main subcomponents:
- SongList
- SelectSong (will display more info on one of the songs)

The Redux will handle state. There will be two **Reducers** (*Song List Reducer* & *Selected Song Reducer*) and one **Action Creator** (*Select Song*).

### Scripts

  

After running `npm install` in the project directory, you can run:

#### `yarn start`


Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
